At the same time, there have been important advances in the\ntheory and algorithms that form the foundation of this field. The goal of this course is to\nprovide an overview of the state-of-art algorithms used in machine learning. Both the\ntheoretical properties of these algorithms and their practical applications will be discussed.",

In recent years, many successful\napplications of machine learning have been developed, ranging from data-mining programs\nthat learn to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, to autonomous vehicles that learn to\ndrive on public highways. At the same time, there have been important advances in the\ntheory and algorithms that form the foundation of this field. The goal of this course is to\nprovide an overview of the state-of-art algorithms used in machine learning. Both the\ntheoretical properties of these algorithms and their practical applications will be discussed.",

Machine learning draws inspiration from many fields, artificial intelligence, statistics, information theory, biology and control theory. The course will cover the following topics; computational learning theory, machine learning concepts, Bayesian learning, supervised learning, classification methods, regression methods, unsupervised learning, clustering methods, artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning, and discussion of advanced machine learning methods.",

The “goodness” of a selected alternative depends on the quality of the data used in describing the decision situation. From this standpoint, a decisionmaking process can fall into one of three categories.\n1. Decisionmaking under uncertainty in which the data cannot be assigned relative weights that represent their degree of relevance in the decision process.\n2. Decisionmaking under risk in which the data can be described by probability distributions.\n3. Decisionmaking under certainty in which the data are known deterministically.\n4. Decision making in multicriteria environment.\nThe main subjects of the course are the decision situation, decision rule, decision trees, information and the cost of additional information, utility theory, multiobjective problems, solution notions for such problems and methods for calculations efficient solutions for multiobjective problems, goal programming and the methods of analyzing solutions for goal programming problems.",

The course starts with a brief recap of classes/objects, methods, encapsulation, input/output, exceptions and the concepts of inheritance, and polymorphism. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java, the use of layout managers and design of event listener objects are introduced. Advanced topics including serialization, XML and JSON data processing, multi-threading, sockets, and database connectivity are discussed. The students are exposed to Junit testing and debugging. The students are expected to complete a project involving the design and implementation of a fairly complex Java program that consists of a GUI and utilizes at least two of the advanced programming areas.",

The “goodness” of a selected alternative depends on the quality of the data used in describing the decision situation. From this standpoint, a decisionmaking process can fall into one of three categories.\n1. Decisionmaking under uncertainty in which the data cannot be assigned relative weights that represent their degree of relevance in the decision process.\n2. Decisionmaking under risk in which the data can be described by probability distributions.\n3. Decisionmaking under certainty in which the data are known deterministically.\n4. Decision making in multicriteria environment.\nThe main subjects of the course are the decision situation, decision rule, decision trees, information and the cost of additional information, utility theory, multiobjective problems, solution notions for such problems and methods for calculations efficient solutions for multiobjective problems, goal programming and the methods of analyzing solutions for goal programming problems.",

They will learn about the concept of arbitrage, and when consideration of such is sufficient to price different investments. Applications to call and put options will be given. Students will learn when arbitrage arguments are not sufficient to evaluate investment opportunities. They will learn to make use of utility theory and mathematical optimization models to determine optimal decisions. Dynamic programming will be introduced and used to solve sequential optimization problems. The use of simulation in financial engineering will be explored.",
