Over time they have given rise to a variety of concepts and theories that attempt to explain their impact on contemporary sociteties, states, and individuals. Multiculturalism cannot be fully understood in isolation from globalisation. In today’s rapidly changing world shaped by globalisation, multiculturalism remains one of the most widely discussed and contested issues—both within academia and in public discourse. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of multiculturalism and globalisation, offering knowledge that is valuable for both research and professional careers beyond academia. By fostering critical thinking and encouraging creativity, it also aims to broaden students’ perspectives, helping them interpret today’s globalised world, address its challanges, and anticipate the near future in a more insightful and enriched way.",

In the concluding weeks, attention will turn to the challenges and future prospects of multiculturalism and globalisation, concluding with student presentations. [Source: Pool 006]",

What do human rights stand for/against? What does it mean to have human rights with a claim to universality? By giving priority to primary texts and documents on human rights, we will try to understand this historical, legal, and political concept both in theory and practice.",

In the first part, we will have a general introduction to the course, and will read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 adopted by the United Nations. In this part, we will also spend time on a broad yet somewhat nuanced enough trajectory of human rights. In so doing, we will try to diagnose and shed light upon certain keystones, radical shifts, and arguably progressive moments in historical development of conceptual, political and legal articulations of human rights. In the second part, we will focus on the early 20th century developments on human rights; such as the two world wars, the Nuremberg Trials, and the international recognition of “crimes against humanity” and genocide. We will spare our last few weeks on the decolonization period onwards. In this part we will discuss issues such as right to self-determination, child labor, migrant workers, and rights of persons with disabilities. [Source: Pool 006]",

        "objectives": "Multiculturalism and Globalisation are central concepts across numerous academic disciplines in the 21st century. Over time they have given rise to a variety of concepts and theories that attempt to explain their impact on contemporary sociteties, states, and individuals. Multiculturalism cannot be fully understood in isolation from globalisation. In today’s rapidly changing world shaped by globalisation, multiculturalism remains one of the most widely discussed and contested issues—both within academia and in public discourse. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of multiculturalism and globalisation, offering knowledge that is valuable for both research and professional careers beyond academia. By fostering critical thinking and encouraging creativity, it also aims to broaden students’ perspectives, helping them interpret today’s globalised world, address its challanges, and anticipate the near future in a more insightful and enriched way.",
        "description": "In the opening weeks, the course will address the topics of multiculturalism and globalisation separately, equipping students with a foundational understanding of these two phenomena. This will be followed by a week dedicated to key theories of multiculturalism and globalisation. In the subsequent weeks, the course will explore the relationship between multiculturalism and globalisation in the context of phenomena such as migration, global inequalities, and populism. In the concluding weeks, attention will turn to the challenges and future prospects of multiculturalism and globalisation, concluding with student presentations. [Source: Pool 006]",

What do human rights stand for/against? What does it mean to have human rights with a claim to universality? By giving priority to primary texts and documents on human rights, we will try to understand this historical, legal, and political concept both in theory and practice.",

In the first part, we will have a general introduction to the course, and will read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 adopted by the United Nations. In this part, we will also spend time on a broad yet somewhat nuanced enough trajectory of human rights. In so doing, we will try to diagnose and shed light upon certain keystones, radical shifts, and arguably progressive moments in historical development of conceptual, political and legal articulations of human rights. In the second part, we will focus on the early 20th century developments on human rights; such as the two world wars, the Nuremberg Trials, and the international recognition of “crimes against humanity” and genocide. We will spare our last few weeks on the decolonization period onwards. In this part we will discuss issues such as right to self-determination, child labor, migrant workers, and rights of persons with disabilities. [Source: Pool 006]",

Decisionmaking under uncertainty in which the data cannot be assigned relative weights that represent their degree of relevance in the decision process.\n2. Decisionmaking under risk in which the data can be described by probability distributions.\n3. Decisionmaking under certainty in which the data are known deterministically.\n4. Decision making in multicriteria environment.\nThe main subjects of the course are the decision situation, decision rule, decision trees, information and the cost of additional information, utility theory, multiobjective problems, solution notions for such problems and methods for calculations efficient solutions for multiobjective problems, goal programming and the methods of analyzing solutions for goal programming problems.",

In this respect, this course offers students to comprehend various issues of politics of environment from the perspective of \"planetary thinking,\" which acknowledges contributions of conventional approaches; but it also brings a new approach by studying \"human life\" and \"human health\" in relation to planetary health that includes animal health, environmental/ecological health, and biodiversity.",

        "objectives": "Multiculturalism and Globalisation are central concepts across numerous academic disciplines in the 21st century. Over time they have given rise to a variety of concepts and theories that attempt to explain their impact on contemporary sociteties, states, and individuals. Multiculturalism cannot be fully understood in isolation from globalisation. In today’s rapidly changing world shaped by globalisation, multiculturalism remains one of the most widely discussed and contested issues—both within academia and in public discourse. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of multiculturalism and globalisation, offering knowledge that is valuable for both research and professional careers beyond academia. By fostering critical thinking and encouraging creativity, it also aims to broaden students’ perspectives, helping them interpret today’s globalised world, address its challanges, and anticipate the near future in a more insightful and enriched way.",
        "description": "In the opening weeks, the course will address the topics of multiculturalism and globalisation separately, equipping students with a foundational understanding of these two phenomena. This will be followed by a week dedicated to key theories of multiculturalism and globalisation. In the subsequent weeks, the course will explore the relationship between multiculturalism and globalisation in the context of phenomena such as migration, global inequalities, and populism. In the concluding weeks, attention will turn to the challenges and future prospects of multiculturalism and globalisation, concluding with student presentations. [Source: Pool 006]",

What do human rights stand for/against? What does it mean to have human rights with a claim to universality? By giving priority to primary texts and documents on human rights, we will try to understand this historical, legal, and political concept both in theory and practice.",

In the first part, we will have a general introduction to the course, and will read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 adopted by the United Nations. In this part, we will also spend time on a broad yet somewhat nuanced enough trajectory of human rights. In so doing, we will try to diagnose and shed light upon certain keystones, radical shifts, and arguably progressive moments in historical development of conceptual, political and legal articulations of human rights. In the second part, we will focus on the early 20th century developments on human rights; such as the two world wars, the Nuremberg Trials, and the international recognition of “crimes against humanity” and genocide. We will spare our last few weeks on the decolonization period onwards. In this part we will discuss issues such as right to self-determination, child labor, migrant workers, and rights of persons with disabilities. [Source: Pool 006]",

Over time they have given rise to a variety of concepts and theories that attempt to explain their impact on contemporary sociteties, states, and individuals. Multiculturalism cannot be fully understood in isolation from globalisation. In today’s rapidly changing world shaped by globalisation, multiculturalism remains one of the most widely discussed and contested issues—both within academia and in public discourse. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of multiculturalism and globalisation, offering knowledge that is valuable for both research and professional careers beyond academia. By fostering critical thinking and encouraging creativity, it also aims to broaden students’ perspectives, helping them interpret today’s globalised world, address its challanges, and anticipate the near future in a more insightful and enriched way.",
        "description": "In the opening weeks, the course will address the topics of multiculturalism and globalisation separately, equipping students with a foundational understanding of these two phenomena. This will be followed by a week dedicated to key theories of multiculturalism and globalisation. In the subsequent weeks, the course will explore the relationship between multiculturalism and globalisation in the context of phenomena such as migration, global inequalities, and populism. In the concluding weeks, attention will turn to the challenges and future prospects of multiculturalism and globalisation, concluding with student presentations. [Source: Pool 006]",

Our aim is to explore certain questions pertaining to human rights: What is it that we call “human rights”? In what historical periods can we locate progress and expansion in human rights? What do human rights stand for/against? What does it mean to have human rights with a claim to universality? By giving priority to primary texts and documents on human rights, we will try to understand this historical, legal, and political concept both in theory and practice.",
        "description": "Our course will proceed on the basis of three parts. In the first part, we will have a general introduction to the course, and will read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 adopted by the United Nations. In this part, we will also spend time on a broad yet somewhat nuanced enough trajectory of human rights. In so doing, we will try to diagnose and shed light upon certain keystones, radical shifts, and arguably progressive moments in historical development of conceptual, political and legal articulations of human rights. In the second part, we will focus on the early 20th century developments on human rights; such as the two world wars, the Nuremberg Trials, and the international recognition of “crimes against humanity” and genocide. We will spare our last few weeks on the decolonization period onwards. In this part we will discuss issues such as right to self-determination, child labor, migrant workers, and rights of persons with disabilities. [Source: Pool 006]",
