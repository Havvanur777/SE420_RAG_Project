Over time they have given rise to a variety of concepts and theories that attempt to explain their impact on contemporary sociteties, states, and individuals. Multiculturalism cannot be fully understood in isolation from globalisation. In today’s rapidly changing world shaped by globalisation, multiculturalism remains one of the most widely discussed and contested issues—both within academia and in public discourse. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of multiculturalism and globalisation, offering knowledge that is valuable for both research and professional careers beyond academia. By fostering critical thinking and encouraging creativity, it also aims to broaden students’ perspectives, helping them interpret today’s globalised world, address its challanges, and anticipate the near future in a more insightful and enriched way.\nDescription: In the opening weeks, the course will address the topics of multiculturalism and globalisation separately, equipping students with a foundational understanding of these two phenomena. This will be followed by a week dedicated to key theories of multiculturalism and globalisation. In the subsequent weeks, the course will explore the relationship between multiculturalism and globalisation in the context of phenomena such as migration, global inequalities, and populism. In the concluding weeks, attention will turn to the challenges and future prospects of multiculturalism and globalisation, concluding with student presentations.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Introduction to the course: Objectives and Expectations; Week 2: What is globalisation?

We will consider gender as a constitutive element of identity and by analyzing its intersection with other categories such as race, class, nation and sexuality, we will grasp the importance of the representation of gender in media and its meaning for our lives. The course consists of lectures, screenings and discussions revolving around critical analysis of and engagement with contemporary examples of film, television, adverts and new media.\nDescription: his course examines various images and representations of gender in media paying particular attention to contemporary discussions. Employing theories from cultural studies, media, film, reception and gender studies, it explores different processes and practices of gender, specifically in terms of media representations of femininity, masculinity and queerness. The media plays a major role in \"constructing\" gender, and “popular” views of what appropriate gendering is, in turn, shape how we communicate with each other.\nParticipation (20%) – You should come to class prepared to ask questions and ready to make lively, insightful,\nsubstantive and respectful contributions to our discussion of the course materials.\nWritten Assignment (20%): These assignments require the students to select a theme we have covered in the class and conduct a detailed analysis of how that example reflects the context in which it\nwas produced/distributed/exhibited.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Course Introduction: Why should and how do we study gender in the media; Week 2: Introduction to Gender and Media; Week 3: Global Perspectives on Gender Representation; Week 4: Feminism and Media; Week 5: Masculinity and Media; Week 6: Queer theory and queer in media; Week 7: Social Media and Influencers; Week 8: Gender and Film; Week 9: Midterm; Week 10: Media, Gender, and Race; Week 11: Gender and News Media; Week 12: Student Presentation; Week 13: Student presentations; Week 14: Student presentatios; Week 15: Evaluation of the term, discussion and preperation for the final exam; Week 16: Final",

Our aim is to explore certain questions pertaining to human rights: What is it that we call “human rights”? In what historical periods can we locate progress and expansion in human rights? What do human rights stand for/against? What does it mean to have human rights with a claim to universality? By giving priority to primary texts and documents on human rights, we will try to understand this historical, legal, and political concept both in theory and practice.\nDescription: Our course will proceed on the basis of three parts. In the first part, we will have a general introduction to the course, and will read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 adopted by the United Nations. In this part, we will also spend time on a broad yet somewhat nuanced enough trajectory of human rights. In so doing, we will try to diagnose and shed light upon certain keystones, radical shifts, and arguably progressive moments in historical development of conceptual, political and legal articulations of human rights. In the second part, we will focus on the early 20th century developments on human rights; such as the two world wars, the Nuremberg Trials, and the international recognition of “crimes against humanity” and genocide. We will spare our last few weeks on the decolonization period onwards. In this part we will discuss issues such as right to self-determination, child labor, migrant workers, and rights of persons with disabilities.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Introduction to the course: Presentation and an overview of the course, course organization, requirements and methods of evaluation; Week 2: Defining the Concept of Human Rights; Week 3: Historical Development and Philosophical Justifications of Human Rights; Week 4: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 5: Genocide and Crimes against Humanity; Week 6: Rights of refugees, migrants, prisoners of war and prevention of torture; Week 7: Midterm I; Week 8: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 9: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 10: Cultural Rights as Human Rights; Week 11: Human rights in Turkey; Week 12: Midterm - II; Week 13: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 14: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 15: Review of the Semester; Week 16: Final Exam",

Massive-scale expansion of urban areas; irreversible processes of deforestation and environmental degradation caused by the idea of \"infinite growth\"; careless urbanization and suburbanization; local and global threats posed by the climate change; and transnational impacts of changing public consumption habits into blind consumerism; all of these developments in the past few centuries address that in our age, the human-nature relationship takes place in the form of an \"ecological crisis,\" meaning the time for taking significant steps towards rethinking of this relationship. In this respect, this course offers students to comprehend various issues of politics of environment from the perspective of \"planetary thinking,\" which acknowledges contributions of conventional approaches; but it also brings a new approach by studying \"human life\" and \"human health\" in relation to planetary health that includes animal health, environmental/ecological health, and biodiversity.\nDescription: This course will develop in three parts. In the first part, we are going to spend some time in understanding the “ecological crisis” by looking at its symptoms and reasons, also climate denialism, and the idea of “planetary thinking” and “planetary health.” In the second part, we are going to elaborate on the critical perspectives towards the idea of environmental justice with an emphasis on green philosophy and politics as well as international cooperation on sustainability and ecological enhancement.

Over time they have given rise to a variety of concepts and theories that attempt to explain their impact on contemporary sociteties, states, and individuals. Multiculturalism cannot be fully understood in isolation from globalisation. In today’s rapidly changing world shaped by globalisation, multiculturalism remains one of the most widely discussed and contested issues—both within academia and in public discourse. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of multiculturalism and globalisation, offering knowledge that is valuable for both research and professional careers beyond academia. By fostering critical thinking and encouraging creativity, it also aims to broaden students’ perspectives, helping them interpret today’s globalised world, address its challanges, and anticipate the near future in a more insightful and enriched way.\nDescription: In the opening weeks, the course will address the topics of multiculturalism and globalisation separately, equipping students with a foundational understanding of these two phenomena. This will be followed by a week dedicated to key theories of multiculturalism and globalisation. In the subsequent weeks, the course will explore the relationship between multiculturalism and globalisation in the context of phenomena such as migration, global inequalities, and populism. In the concluding weeks, attention will turn to the challenges and future prospects of multiculturalism and globalisation, concluding with student presentations.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Introduction to the course: Objectives and Expectations; Week 2: What is globalisation?

Our aim is to explore certain questions pertaining to human rights: What is it that we call “human rights”? In what historical periods can we locate progress and expansion in human rights? What do human rights stand for/against? What does it mean to have human rights with a claim to universality? By giving priority to primary texts and documents on human rights, we will try to understand this historical, legal, and political concept both in theory and practice.\nDescription: Our course will proceed on the basis of three parts. In the first part, we will have a general introduction to the course, and will read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 adopted by the United Nations. In this part, we will also spend time on a broad yet somewhat nuanced enough trajectory of human rights. In so doing, we will try to diagnose and shed light upon certain keystones, radical shifts, and arguably progressive moments in historical development of conceptual, political and legal articulations of human rights. In the second part, we will focus on the early 20th century developments on human rights; such as the two world wars, the Nuremberg Trials, and the international recognition of “crimes against humanity” and genocide. We will spare our last few weeks on the decolonization period onwards. In this part we will discuss issues such as right to self-determination, child labor, migrant workers, and rights of persons with disabilities.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Introduction to the course: Presentation and an overview of the course, course organization, requirements and methods of evaluation; Week 2: Defining the Concept of Human Rights; Week 3: Historical Development and Philosophical Justifications of Human Rights; Week 4: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 5: Genocide and Crimes against Humanity; Week 6: Rights of refugees, migrants, prisoners of war and prevention of torture; Week 7: Midterm I; Week 8: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 9: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 10: Cultural Rights as Human Rights; Week 11: Human rights in Turkey; Week 12: Midterm - II; Week 13: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 14: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 15: Review of the Semester; Week 16: Final Exam",

The “goodness” of a selected alternative depends on the quality of the data used in describing the decision situation. From this standpoint, a decisionmaking process can fall into one of three categories.\n1. Decisionmaking under uncertainty in which the data cannot be assigned relative weights that represent their degree of relevance in the decision process.\n2. Decisionmaking under risk in which the data can be described by probability distributions.\n3. Decisionmaking under certainty in which the data are known deterministically.\n4. Decision making in multicriteria environment.\nThe main subjects of the course are the decision situation, decision rule, decision trees, information and the cost of additional information, utility theory, multiobjective problems, solution notions for such problems and methods for calculations efficient solutions for multiobjective problems, goal programming and the methods of analyzing solutions for goal programming problems.\nPrerequisites: MATH 240To succeed (To get a grade of at least DD)\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Review of the Semester; Week 2: Review of the Semester; Week 3: Review of the Semester; Week 4: Review of the Semester; Week 5: Review of the Semester; Week 6: Review of the Semester; Week 7: Review of the Semester; Week 8: Review of the Semester; Week 9: Review of the Semester; Week 10: Review of the Semester; Week 11: Review of the Semester; Week 12: Review of the Semester; Week 13: Review of the Semester; Week 14: Review of the Semester; Week 15: Review of the Semester; Week 16: Review of the Semester",

Massive-scale expansion of urban areas; irreversible processes of deforestation and environmental degradation caused by the idea of \"infinite growth\"; careless urbanization and suburbanization; local and global threats posed by the climate change; and transnational impacts of changing public consumption habits into blind consumerism; all of these developments in the past few centuries address that in our age, the human-nature relationship takes place in the form of an \"ecological crisis,\" meaning the time for taking significant steps towards rethinking of this relationship. In this respect, this course offers students to comprehend various issues of politics of environment from the perspective of \"planetary thinking,\" which acknowledges contributions of conventional approaches; but it also brings a new approach by studying \"human life\" and \"human health\" in relation to planetary health that includes animal health, environmental/ecological health, and biodiversity.\nDescription: This course will develop in three parts. In the first part, we are going to spend some time in understanding the “ecological crisis” by looking at its symptoms and reasons, also climate denialism, and the idea of “planetary thinking” and “planetary health.” In the second part, we are going to elaborate on the critical perspectives towards the idea of environmental justice with an emphasis on green philosophy and politics as well as international cooperation on sustainability and ecological enhancement.

We will consider gender as a constitutive element of identity and by analyzing its intersection with other categories such as race, class, nation and sexuality, we will grasp the importance of the representation of gender in media and its meaning for our lives. The course consists of lectures, screenings and discussions revolving around critical analysis of and engagement with contemporary examples of film, television, adverts and new media.\nDescription: his course examines various images and representations of gender in media paying particular attention to contemporary discussions. Employing theories from cultural studies, media, film, reception and gender studies, it explores different processes and practices of gender, specifically in terms of media representations of femininity, masculinity and queerness. The media plays a major role in \"constructing\" gender, and “popular” views of what appropriate gendering is, in turn, shape how we communicate with each other.\nParticipation (20%) – You should come to class prepared to ask questions and ready to make lively, insightful,\nsubstantive and respectful contributions to our discussion of the course materials.\nWritten Assignment (20%): These assignments require the students to select a theme we have covered in the class and conduct a detailed analysis of how that example reflects the context in which it\nwas produced/distributed/exhibited.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Course Introduction: Why should and how do we study gender in the media; Week 2: Introduction to Gender and Media; Week 3: Global Perspectives on Gender Representation; Week 4: Feminism and Media; Week 5: Masculinity and Media; Week 6: Queer theory and queer in media; Week 7: Social Media and Influencers; Week 8: Gender and Film; Week 9: Midterm; Week 10: Media, Gender, and Race; Week 11: Gender and News Media; Week 12: Student Presentation; Week 13: Student presentations; Week 14: Student presentatios; Week 15: Evaluation of the term, discussion and preperation for the final exam; Week 16: Final",

Our aim is to explore certain questions pertaining to human rights: What is it that we call “human rights”? In what historical periods can we locate progress and expansion in human rights? What do human rights stand for/against? What does it mean to have human rights with a claim to universality? By giving priority to primary texts and documents on human rights, we will try to understand this historical, legal, and political concept both in theory and practice.\nDescription: Our course will proceed on the basis of three parts. In the first part, we will have a general introduction to the course, and will read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 adopted by the United Nations. In this part, we will also spend time on a broad yet somewhat nuanced enough trajectory of human rights. In so doing, we will try to diagnose and shed light upon certain keystones, radical shifts, and arguably progressive moments in historical development of conceptual, political and legal articulations of human rights. In the second part, we will focus on the early 20th century developments on human rights; such as the two world wars, the Nuremberg Trials, and the international recognition of “crimes against humanity” and genocide. We will spare our last few weeks on the decolonization period onwards. In this part we will discuss issues such as right to self-determination, child labor, migrant workers, and rights of persons with disabilities.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Introduction to the course: Presentation and an overview of the course, course organization, requirements and methods of evaluation; Week 2: Defining the Concept of Human Rights; Week 3: Historical Development and Philosophical Justifications of Human Rights; Week 4: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 5: Genocide and Crimes against Humanity; Week 6: Rights of refugees, migrants, prisoners of war and prevention of torture; Week 7: Midterm I; Week 8: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 9: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 10: Cultural Rights as Human Rights; Week 11: Human rights in Turkey; Week 12: Midterm - II; Week 13: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 14: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 15: Review of the Semester; Week 16: Final Exam",

Over time they have given rise to a variety of concepts and theories that attempt to explain their impact on contemporary sociteties, states, and individuals. Multiculturalism cannot be fully understood in isolation from globalisation. In today’s rapidly changing world shaped by globalisation, multiculturalism remains one of the most widely discussed and contested issues—both within academia and in public discourse. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of multiculturalism and globalisation, offering knowledge that is valuable for both research and professional careers beyond academia. By fostering critical thinking and encouraging creativity, it also aims to broaden students’ perspectives, helping them interpret today’s globalised world, address its challanges, and anticipate the near future in a more insightful and enriched way.\nDescription: In the opening weeks, the course will address the topics of multiculturalism and globalisation separately, equipping students with a foundational understanding of these two phenomena. This will be followed by a week dedicated to key theories of multiculturalism and globalisation. In the subsequent weeks, the course will explore the relationship between multiculturalism and globalisation in the context of phenomena such as migration, global inequalities, and populism. In the concluding weeks, attention will turn to the challenges and future prospects of multiculturalism and globalisation, concluding with student presentations.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Introduction to the course: Objectives and Expectations; Week 2: What is globalisation?

We will consider gender as a constitutive element of identity and by analyzing its intersection with other categories such as race, class, nation and sexuality, we will grasp the importance of the representation of gender in media and its meaning for our lives. The course consists of lectures, screenings and discussions revolving around critical analysis of and engagement with contemporary examples of film, television, adverts and new media.\nDescription: his course examines various images and representations of gender in media paying particular attention to contemporary discussions. Employing theories from cultural studies, media, film, reception and gender studies, it explores different processes and practices of gender, specifically in terms of media representations of femininity, masculinity and queerness. The media plays a major role in \"constructing\" gender, and “popular” views of what appropriate gendering is, in turn, shape how we communicate with each other.\nParticipation (20%) – You should come to class prepared to ask questions and ready to make lively, insightful,\nsubstantive and respectful contributions to our discussion of the course materials.\nWritten Assignment (20%): These assignments require the students to select a theme we have covered in the class and conduct a detailed analysis of how that example reflects the context in which it\nwas produced/distributed/exhibited.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Course Introduction: Why should and how do we study gender in the media; Week 2: Introduction to Gender and Media; Week 3: Global Perspectives on Gender Representation; Week 4: Feminism and Media; Week 5: Masculinity and Media; Week 6: Queer theory and queer in media; Week 7: Social Media and Influencers; Week 8: Gender and Film; Week 9: Midterm; Week 10: Media, Gender, and Race; Week 11: Gender and News Media; Week 12: Student Presentation; Week 13: Student presentations; Week 14: Student presentatios; Week 15: Evaluation of the term, discussion and preperation for the final exam; Week 16: Final",

Our aim is to explore certain questions pertaining to human rights: What is it that we call “human rights”? In what historical periods can we locate progress and expansion in human rights? What do human rights stand for/against? What does it mean to have human rights with a claim to universality? By giving priority to primary texts and documents on human rights, we will try to understand this historical, legal, and political concept both in theory and practice.\nDescription: Our course will proceed on the basis of three parts. In the first part, we will have a general introduction to the course, and will read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 adopted by the United Nations. In this part, we will also spend time on a broad yet somewhat nuanced enough trajectory of human rights. In so doing, we will try to diagnose and shed light upon certain keystones, radical shifts, and arguably progressive moments in historical development of conceptual, political and legal articulations of human rights. In the second part, we will focus on the early 20th century developments on human rights; such as the two world wars, the Nuremberg Trials, and the international recognition of “crimes against humanity” and genocide. We will spare our last few weeks on the decolonization period onwards. In this part we will discuss issues such as right to self-determination, child labor, migrant workers, and rights of persons with disabilities.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Introduction to the course: Presentation and an overview of the course, course organization, requirements and methods of evaluation; Week 2: Defining the Concept of Human Rights; Week 3: Historical Development and Philosophical Justifications of Human Rights; Week 4: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 5: Genocide and Crimes against Humanity; Week 6: Rights of refugees, migrants, prisoners of war and prevention of torture; Week 7: Midterm I; Week 8: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 9: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 10: Cultural Rights as Human Rights; Week 11: Human rights in Turkey; Week 12: Midterm - II; Week 13: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 14: Human Rights and Political Theory; Week 15: Review of the Semester; Week 16: Final Exam",

Massive-scale expansion of urban areas; irreversible processes of deforestation and environmental degradation caused by the idea of \"infinite growth\"; careless urbanization and suburbanization; local and global threats posed by the climate change; and transnational impacts of changing public consumption habits into blind consumerism; all of these developments in the past few centuries address that in our age, the human-nature relationship takes place in the form of an \"ecological crisis,\" meaning the time for taking significant steps towards rethinking of this relationship. In this respect, this course offers students to comprehend various issues of politics of environment from the perspective of \"planetary thinking,\" which acknowledges contributions of conventional approaches; but it also brings a new approach by studying \"human life\" and \"human health\" in relation to planetary health that includes animal health, environmental/ecological health, and biodiversity.\nDescription: This course will develop in three parts. In the first part, we are going to spend some time in understanding the “ecological crisis” by looking at its symptoms and reasons, also climate denialism, and the idea of “planetary thinking” and “planetary health.” In the second part, we are going to elaborate on the critical perspectives towards the idea of environmental justice with an emphasis on green philosophy and politics as well as international cooperation on sustainability and ecological enhancement. We will devote the final part of the course on current debates.\nPrerequisites: None\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Introduction to the course: Objectives and Expectations; Week 2: Ecology and the Emergence of Environmental Politics; Week 3: The Rise and Fall of Developmentalism and “Infinite Growth”; Week 4: Actors and Regimes of Environmental Politics; Week 5: Approaches 1: Population and Scarcity vs. Institutions and Commons; Week 6: Approaches 2: Environmental Justice *Deadline for setting up presentation groups; Week 7: Midterm; Week 8: Making Sense of the “Crisis” of Ecology; Week 9: Climate Change: Denialist vs. Alarmist Controversy **Deadline for submitting presentation topics with brief descriptions; Week 10: Solutions 1: Transnational Activism/ Environmental Movements ***Feedback on presentation topics; Week 11: Solutions 2: “Planetary Health”; Week 12: Presentations; Week 13: Presentations; Week 14: Presentations; Week 15: Review of the Semester; Week 16: Final Exam",

The “goodness” of a selected alternative depends on the quality of the data used in describing the decision situation. From this standpoint, a decisionmaking process can fall into one of three categories.\n1. Decisionmaking under uncertainty in which the data cannot be assigned relative weights that represent their degree of relevance in the decision process.\n2. Decisionmaking under risk in which the data can be described by probability distributions.\n3. Decisionmaking under certainty in which the data are known deterministically.\n4. Decision making in multicriteria environment.\nThe main subjects of the course are the decision situation, decision rule, decision trees, information and the cost of additional information, utility theory, multiobjective problems, solution notions for such problems and methods for calculations efficient solutions for multiobjective problems, goal programming and the methods of analyzing solutions for goal programming problems.\nPrerequisites: MATH 240To succeed (To get a grade of at least DD)\nWeekly Topics: Week 1: Review of the Semester; Week 2: Review of the Semester; Week 3: Review of the Semester; Week 4: Review of the Semester; Week 5: Review of the Semester; Week 6: Review of the Semester; Week 7: Review of the Semester; Week 8: Review of the Semester; Week 9: Review of the Semester; Week 10: Review of the Semester; Week 11: Review of the Semester; Week 12: Review of the Semester; Week 13: Review of the Semester; Week 14: Review of the Semester; Week 15: Review of the Semester; Week 16: Review of the Semester",
